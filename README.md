## Objective
- I am hired as a consultant by Dominos Pizza. They want my help to collect and summarize appropriate data to be used in a marketing advertisement that makes a comparison between their Competitors (eg.Debonairs Pizza).

- I was asked to prepare a memorandum to the Dominos Pizza CEO describing how I could conduct such a study to support claims focusing on one or more of the companyâ€™s strengths (such as amount of toppings, speed of service, customer satisfaction, etc.). 
 


## My memorandum 


Dear CEO,

- I am writing to present a proposal for a study that will collect and summarize data to be used in a marketing advertisement comparing Dominos Pizza to our main competitor. The study will focus on three strengths of our company: the variety of toppings offered, the speed of service, and the impact of bonus and customer segment marketing on customer behavior.

## Research Questions:

How does the variety of toppings offered by Dominos Pizza compare to the variety offered by our main competitor?
How does the speed of service at Dominos Pizza compare to the speed of service at our main competitor?
How does the use of bonus and customer segment marketing impact customer behavior and attract more customers to Dominos Pizza?
Variables to be Recorded:

#### Variety of toppings offered: 
To measure the variety of toppings offered, we will count the number of different toppings available for each pizza at Dominos Pizza and at our main competitor.

#### Speed of service: 
To measure the speed of service, we will time the amount of time it takes to place an order, receive a pizza, and receive the check for each transaction at both Dominos Pizza and our main competitor.

#### Customer frequency and recency: 
To measure customer behavior, we will keep track of the number of times each customer visits Dominos Pizza and how recently they visited.

## Data Collection:

#### Variety of toppings offered: 
Data for this variable will be collected by counting the number of different toppings available for each pizza at Dominos Pizza and at our main competitor.

#### Speed of service: 
Data for this variable will be collected by timing the amount of time it takes to place an order, receive a pizza, and receive the check for each transaction at both Dominos Pizza and our main competitor.
Customer frequency and recency: Data for these variables will be collected by keeping track of the number of times each customer visits Dominos Pizza and how recently they visited.

## Data Summaries:

#### Variety of toppings offered: 
To summarize the data for this variable, we will use a bar graph to compare the number of different toppings available for each pizza at Dominos Pizza and at our main competitor. We will also use a numerical summary, such as the mean or median, to describe the average number of toppings available for each pizza.

#### Speed of service: 
To summarize the data for this variable, we will use a boxplot to compare the distribution of the time it takes to place an order, receive a pizza, and receive the check for each transaction at both Dominos Pizza and our main competitor. We will also use a numerical summary, such as the mean or median, to describe the average time it takes for each transaction.

#### Customer frequency and recency: 
To summarize the data for these variables, we will use a histogram to visualize the distribution of customer visits to Dominos Pizza and how recently they visited. We will also use numerical summaries, such as the mean or median, to describe the average number of visits and average recency of visits for each customer.

## In conclusion,
The study design we have proposed will allow us to collect and summarize data to be used in a marketing advertisement comparing Dominos Pizza to our main competitor. By focusing on the variety of toppings offered, the speed of service, and the impact of bonus and customer segment marketing on customer behavior, we can demonstrate the strengths of our company and provide valuable information for potential customers.

  I look forward to hearing your thoughts on this proposal.

`Yours Sincerely`,
